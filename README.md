# The Smallweb Subway
The Smallweb Subway is an experimental project that attempts to bring a feeling
of space to the indie web by using a subway system as a metaphor for
connections between indie websites!

This is a work in progress, so right now the Smallweb Subway is only made up
of a single line (webring), but eventually I plan to add more interest-based
lines and a map to visualize the connectivity of the lines.
